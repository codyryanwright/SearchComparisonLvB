I would guess that the Big O Notation for binary search is O(logn) because it is almost
linear but I know that it is more than one instruction so that's why I choose the next best.

For linear search I would guess that it is O(n) because it is directly dependent on the
size of the array and slower than binary (after the sort time is averaged out).

I did 1000 iterations because the time it takes to sort for binary is on average longer
than the time it takes to linear search. STL Sort: O(nlogn) vs. Linear Search: O(n)
5 iterations still showed linear to be faster,but I knew over many iterations binary
should overtake it. This proved true, especially for 1000 iterations over a 1 billion
sized array.

Since the fingerprint file will be used by multiple agencies with thousands of agents,
it's safe to say that binary search is the best implementation.
